# Analysis Methodology

## Research Overview
This thesis investigates the relationship between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and fishery collapse, examining both the biological and economic impacts.

## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Data Exploration
- Load and inspect fishery datasets
- Analyze SST data time series
- Identify correlations and patterns

### Phase 2: Statistical Analysis
- Perform statistical tests for relationships
- Time series decomposition
- Anomaly detection in fishery data

### Phase 3: Modeling
- Develop predictive models for fishery collapse
- Economic impact modeling
- Scenario analysis

### Phase 4: Visualization & Results
- Create publication-quality figures
- Generate summary statistics
- Document findings
